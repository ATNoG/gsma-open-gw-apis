# Context

The evolution of 5G and beyond has introduced advanced network capabilities, enabling greater access, reconfiguration, and flexibility. This opens new opportunities for developers across industries to create integrated solutions using telecom operators' services. However, current interfaces defined by 3GPP are complex, requiring deep technical knowledge, which limits adoption.

## _GSMA Open Gateway APIs_

The GSMA Open Gateway is a framework of universal network APIs designed to give developers and cloud providers seamless access to mobile operators' networks. This initiative aims to enhance and accelerate the deployment of services across global telecom networks by providing a single, standardized point of access for developers. By exposing mobile network capabilities such as device location, SIM swap, and quality on demand (QoD), the Open Gateway enables developers to create innovative services that leverage 5G and cloud infrastructure.

## Problem and Objective

### _The problem_

Due to several restrictions, most of the Open Gateway APIs are not offered by network operators. Nonetheless, it is expected that operators will begin offering them soon, making it essential for developers to start preparing their applications to integrate with these APIs.

### _Project objective_

Given that “Instituto de Telecomunicações” (IT), in Aveiro, has access to a commercial 5G core, there is a high interest in integrating GSMA Open Gateway APIs with their current 5G deployment. Therefore, the goal is to implement a subset of these Open Gateway APIs and integrate them with IT’s 5G deployment.
