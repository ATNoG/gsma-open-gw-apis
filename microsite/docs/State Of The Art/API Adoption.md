# API Adoption

Although these initiatives are relatively new, there are already operators implementing the APIs defined by CAMARA and the GSMA Open Gateway.

**Ericsson**, as a multinational telecommunications company, has begun implementing the APIs defined by the CAMARA project[^1]. In collaboration with companies such as Google Cloud, Deutsche Telekom, Reliance Jio, and T-Mobile[^2], Ericsson is now part of an initiative called **Aduna**, where they are developing and adopting a set of CAMARA APIs. The first APIs to be supported will primarily focus on fraud prevention, with the aim of verifying numbers assigned to customers and an API designed to facilitate the SIM Swapping process [^3].

Similarly, in the Middle East and North Africa region, the operator **Ooredoo** has recently implemented CAMARA APIs to provide new opportunities for businesses (customers)[^4]. 
This reaffirms the commitment made by various operators to the **GSMA Open Gateway** and the **CAMARA initiative**.

Like **Aduna**, **Ooredoo** has also started offering programmatic SIM Swapping and is providing the necessary tools for implementing One Time Password (OTP) via SMS.

Finally, the four main mobile operators in France (**Bouygues Telecom**, **Free**, **Orange**, and **SFR**) have announced a partnership to launch network APIs aimed at combating online fraud and protecting digital identities. As part of the global **GSMA Open Gateway initiative**, they will offer three APIs in the French market: Know Your Customer (KYC) Match, SIM Swapping, and Number Verification. These APIs have been tested with banks and businesses in France and are expected to be commercially launched in the first half of 2025[^5].
