### Feedback and Improvements

For this milestone, we received feedback from our professors highlighting areas for improvement, including poor time management, as we exceeded the allotted presentation time. To address this, we began conducting practice runs with our tutor to refine our delivery. Additionally, we were questioned about whether our project was solely focused on API implementation. In response, we emphasized that our work not only involved developing APIs but also deploying various services to ensure a comprehensive solution.

Additionally, we also made sure to point out, in an email sent to the course's regent, that as we were working with a fairly new technology aimed at the industry, and not academic research, the quantity of **research papers** was reduced which meant we were going to use mostly **white papers** and **press releases**. Moreover, we also asked the course's regent if there would be any impact if we did not show a **graphic interface**, as our project is not aimed at a final client that would work with a **User Interface**, instead it is aimed at developers that would integrate our solution with their product. We were told that it would not have any impact; however, we had to show the result of our work over the semester.

## Milestone 2

On this milestone, we were required to present a brief overview of our project, a more in-depth view on the state of the art, the requirements we gathered (functional and non-functional) and our system's architecture.

## Milestone 3

On this milestone, we were tasked in presenting some of the prior information, such as the context of the project and the architecture, due to the previous checkpoint we also presented the calendar changes we had to make, because of some problems we were facing. However, the main point of this milestone was presenting a demonstration of our work until that point, where we showed our working IMS, SMS One Time Passwords(OTP) and finally the Location APIs working.
