# CAMARA Initiative

CAMARA is an initiative focused on defining, developing, and validating Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) APIs \[[1](https://doi.org/10.1145/3538401.3546825)\]. These APIs are being designed for rapid implementation to achieve one of CAMARAâ€™s main goals: ensuring adoption by operators to create a unified, vendor-independent interface that allows third parties to interact with 5G services without needing direct contact with operators.

Another key objective of CAMARA is making its APIs accessible to developers without experience in 5G or telecommunications. This ensures that developers can use the services easily without interacting with vendors or learning complex telecom details to utilize 3GPP APIs.

This initiative is closely linked to the GSMA Open Gateway, as the APIs will be published through the CAMARA project \[[2](https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/The-Programmable-5G-Network-and-API-Ecosystem.pdf)\]. Additionally, GSMA Open Gateway, CAMARA, and TMF are aligned to bring 5G capabilities to the market in a more accessible and standardized way.
