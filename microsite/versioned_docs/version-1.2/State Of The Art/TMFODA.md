# TMF Open Digital Architecture

The **Open Digital Architecture (ODA)** is a framework created by **TM Forum (TMF)** to help service providers transition to open and interoperable solutions. This framework spans multiple areas, addressing not only technical aspects but also business processes.

In our project, the most relevant aspect is the **OpenAPIs** defined within this framework, which establish **domain-independent interfaces** for resource and service offerings. Particularly important are the interfaces that enable **service catalog retrieval, service acquisition, and lifecycle management**.

The **TMF APIs** are more **generic** than those offered by the **GSMA Open Gateway**, providing more operations but also increasing complexity compared to the **simpler** GSMA Open Gateway APIs. Additionally, the **GSMA Open Gateway** supports an **aggregation model**, where an aggregator can provide access to **multiple operators' GSMA Open Gateway APIs in a unified way**, eliminating the need for direct contact with each operator.

An interesting collaboration between these two projects is the use of **TMF APIs** to enable the **GSMA Open Gateway as a service** offered by operators and aggregators. In this scenario, TMF APIs would allow customers to **acquire a service** that provides access to a GSMA Open Gateway, which would be **automatically orchestrated and deployed**, strengthening the operator/aggregator’s offering and simplifying the developer’s process of gaining access to the GSMA Open Gateway.
