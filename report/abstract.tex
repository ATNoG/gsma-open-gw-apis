The GSMA Open Gateway is a global initiative that aims to offer
software developers access to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) 5G
Networks. This access enables the development of solutions that
would be able to access network information and reconfigure said
network, offering end users integrated experiences. These consist
in utilizing the network integration to improve existing use
cases and support new ones, such as fraud detection,
\emph{Quality-on-Demand} and advanced fleet management.

The access is made through a set of programmatic interfaces that
unify and simplify the existing operator interfaces, handling all
the required legislation in matters of privacy and data
protection.

Although most operators do not offer these interfaces, it is
expected that they will do so in the future, therefore having the
necessity of developers to start designing and implementing
different projects using these. Our project aims to offer
implementations of these interfaces through \emph{Instituto de
Telecomunicações} 5G Infrastructure, in Aveiro.
