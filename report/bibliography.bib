	abstract = {Network as a Service (NaaS) allows operators to expose network
	            capabilities to 3rd parties in a programmatic manner (through APIs)
	            , offering them consumer-like experience with choice, scalability,
	            visibility and control. After several years in scope of research,
	            NaaS is now gaining momentum in industry. Proof of this is that the
	            Linux Foundation and the GSMA have together unveiled a new open
	            source project called CAMARA, which has the mission to create an
	            open, global and accessible portfolio of APIs for developers and
	            customers, so that they can access operator capabilities and
	            consume them as per their service needs. This exposure allows for
	            service-tailored network programmability and frictionless
	            network-application integration, strengthening ties between
	            operators and 3rd parties for service co-creation. In this article,
	            we present the "Quality on Demand API", the first NaaS API
	            published and validated by CAMARA. The implementation and
	            validation of this API is showcased in a relevant business case for
	            operators, based on connecting end-users with a 3rd party video
	            streaming server using a 5G stand-alone network.},
